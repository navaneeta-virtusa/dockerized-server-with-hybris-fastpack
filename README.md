# A Dockerized Dyantrace Server/Collector for hybris eCommerce Platforms
This Docker configuration build automatically sets up a Dyantrace Server based on Ubuntu Linux. It will also fetch and install the latest Dynatrace Monitoring Fastpack for the hybris eCommerce platform.

Note that this setup is meant for a local, dev/demo style use. There is no data persistency on external volumes or databases.
